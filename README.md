# Belly Button Research
*A JavaScript Interactive Dashboard*
## Project Overview
### Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard, a creative visualization that offers interactivity which can help the audience better understand the data and draw the same conclusions as researchers and data analyst.  The purpose of this research is to gather, identify, and analyze the biological footprint of individuals’ naval and their unique naval bacteria.   
The research and data file provided holds data of 153 individuals and their: 
-	Unique and anonymous IDs
-	Demographic details
-	Belly button scrubbing frequency
-	Belly button biological “footprint”
### Results
Raw data from JavaScript array is now displayed in a dynamic dashboard with a pull down menu programmed to allow the user to explore.  They can 
do a deep dive into their own results or compare to others. The dashboard can be found at the link that follows.  Please try it on your own.

### Background & the Process of Development  -write this part next 
In this development, we used **JavaScript** as the primary coding language along with Plotly.js library.  The combination of the two allows
Users to not be required to install additional programs, such as  **JavaScript**, on their computers in order to run the code. 
JavaScript enables us to create visualizet in that are attractive, accessible, and interactive,   

### Resources
 -  The data for the table is stored in a JavaScript array or list named **samples.json**
 -  The table is built by inserting **JavaScript** into **HTML** page. *charts.js*.
 -  **HTML** is used to to build the webpage *index.html*. 
 -  **CSS** and **Bootstrap** then builds and styles the page *style.css*.  
 -  Fire fox Developer Tools are ideal to test the code as we progress through the development.    
 -  Further we use a new Dependency named **D3**. 
 -  Additionally, we deployed the final results of Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard on **GitHub**

 This is an interactive page, so please experiment and try it out!
