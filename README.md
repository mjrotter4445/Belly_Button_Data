The research and data file provided holds data of 153 individuals and their: 
-	Unique and anonymous IDs
-	Demographic details
-	Belly button scrubbing frequency
-	Belly button biological “footprint”

### Background & the Process of Development  -write this part next 
In this development, we used **JavaScript** as the primary coding language along with Plotly.js library.  The combination of the two allows
Users to not be required to install additional programs, such as  **JavaScript**, on their computers in order to run the code. 
JavaScript enables us to create visualizet in that are attractive, accessible, and interactive,

### Resources
 -  The data for the table is stored in a JavaScript array or list named **data.js**
 -  The table is built by inserting **JavaScript** into **HTML** page. *app.py*.
 -  **HTML** is used to to build the webpage *index.html*. 
 -  **CSS** and **Boostrap** then builds and styles the page *style.css*.  
 -  Fire fox Developer Tools are ideal to test the code as we progress through the development.    
 -  Further we use a new Dependency named **D3**.
